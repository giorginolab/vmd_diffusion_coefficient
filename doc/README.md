Diffusion Coefficient Tool
==========================


The [Diffusion Coefficient Tool](#) is an analysis plugin for VMD that computes one, two or three-dimensional mean squared displacements (MSD)-based diffusion coefficients of a chosen molecular species.


**Note.** The Diffusion Coefficient Tool is not a magic box. It only computes mean squared displacements (MSD) at a variety of lag times (τ). The MSD is predicted by Einstein's relation to grow linearly with τ. Most often than not, this DOES NOT occur in practice, for a variety of reasons, including poor sampling or non-diffusive behavior. It is YOUR responsibility to understand why and, if you trust the linearity, to fit the slope. Please consider the following paper to be **mandatory reading**: [David Keffer, The Working Man's Guide to Obtaining Self Diffusion Coefficients from Molecular Dynamics Simulations](http://utkstair.org/clausius/docs/che548/pdf/selfD.pdf).

Usage (GUI)
-----------

The plugin is accessible from VMD in *Extensions \> Analysis \> Diffusion Coefficient Tool*. The profile is computed for the currently loaded trajectory in the *top* molecule. The atom selection must match one atom per diffusing molecule; MSD values will be averaged over the matched atoms.

Two buttons are provided to plot the **MSD displacement** MSD(τ) and the **Diffusion coefficient** D(τ). The latter is computed with the Einstein relation as *D(τ)=MSD(τ)/2Eτ*, where *E* is the integer dimensionality of the system (1, 2 or 3). (Note that it's not a linear fit.)

The **Analysis interval** boxes allow to specify a subsection of the trajectory to be used for the MSD calculation. Only displacements in the subspace spanned by the **Diffusion along** axes will be considered. In other words, if *z* is deselected, motions along that axes will be irrelevant for the calculation of MSD and D.

The results are given in Å<sup>2</sup>/ns. Conversion factors:

-   0.1 Å<sup>2</sup>/ns = 10<sup>-12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s = 10<sup>-8</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s = 1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s

-   1 cm²/s = 10<sup>7</sup> Å²/ns

-   1 m²/s = 10<sup>11</sup> Å²/ns

-   1 μm²/s = 0.1 Å²/ns

-   1 Å²/ns = 10<sup>-7</sup> cm²/s = 10<sup>-11</sup> m²/s = 10 μm²/s

Upon completion, the location of a data file with the computed profiles will be printed on the console.


Warnings
--------

-   Computing converged diffusion coefficients is likely beyond your sampling capacity and patience, unless done for plenty of molecules (ie. solvent). Don't draw premature conclusions: expect **microseconds** sampling.

-   The trajectory must not be wrapped.

-   A check is performed whether bonds exist between the selected atoms. This check may fail if wrong connectivity is inferred on molecule load;



Usage (command line)
--------------------

You need to load the package with `package require diffusion_coefficient`. The plugin can perform the following computations

-   MSD at a given lag time (in frames). The return value will be in Å, and its value is independent of the time units. This is the clearest (i.e. recommended) way to use the plugin.

-   MSD for an interval of lag times

-   D, computed as above, for an interval of lag times.

Invocation is self-explanatory, i.e.:

    VMD Diffusion Coefficient tool. Computes one, two or three-dimensional
    MSD-based diffusion coefficients of a chosen molecular species.

    Usage: diffusion_coefficient <options> <command>

    Command is one of:
    -msd <NN>     Compute mean squared displacement (MSD) at a tau of
                  NN frames; equivalent to msd_interval -from NN -to NN.
                  Returns a value as Angstrom^2 . This is the recommended 
                  way of using the plugin.
    -msd range    Compute MSD for taus between -from and -to (mandatory)
                  Returns two lists of {tau} {MSD(tau)}
    -d range      Compute D(tau)=MSD(tau)/(2*D*tau) between -from and
                  -to (mandatory). Returns two lists of {tau} {D(tau)}
