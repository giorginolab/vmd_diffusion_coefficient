	abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more “representations,” in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

	abstract = {Lipid composition is expected to play an important role in modulating membrane enzyme activity, in particular if the substrates are themselves lipid molecules. A paradigmatic case is FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase), an enzyme critical in terminating endocannabinoid signalling and an important therapeutic target. In the present study, using a combined experimental and computational approach, we show that membrane lipids modulate the structure, subcellular localization and activity of FAAH. We report that the FAAH dimer is stabilized by the lipid bilayer and shows a higher membrane-binding affinity and enzymatic activity within membranes containing both cholesterol and the natural FAAH substrate AEA (anandamide). Additionally, co-localization of cholesterol, AEA and FAAH in mouse neuroblastoma cells suggests a mechanism through which cholesterol increases the substrate accessibility of FAAH.},

    abstract = {Membrane levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (ω-3 PUFA), are decreased in common neuropsychiatric disorders. DHA modulates key cell membrane properties like fluidity, thereby affecting the behaviour of transmembrane proteins like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors, which have special relevance for major neuropsychiatric disorders have recently been shown to form dimers or higher order oligomers, and evidence suggests that DHA levels affect GPCR function by modulating oligomerisation. In this study, we assessed the effect of membrane DHA content on the formation of a class of protein complexes with particular relevance for brain disease: adenosine A2A and dopamine D2 receptor oligomers. Using extensive multiscale computer modelling, we find a marked propensity of DHA for interaction with both A2A and D2 receptors, which leads to an increased rate of receptor oligomerisation. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments performed on living cells suggest that this DHA effect on the oligomerisation of A2A and D2 receptors is purely kinetic. This work reveals for the first time that membrane ω-3 PUFAs play a key role in GPCR oligomerisation kinetics, which may have important implications for neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia or Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a popular technique for studying the atomistic behavior of any molecular system. Performing MD simulations requires a user to become familiar with the commands, options, and ﬁle formats of the chosen simulation software, none of which are consistent across diﬀerent programs. Beyond these requirements, users are expected to be familiar with various aspects of physics, mathematics, computer programming, and interaction with a command-line environment, presenting critical barriers to entry in the MD simulation ﬁeld. This article presents seven tutorials for instructing users in the proper methods for preparing and carrying out diﬀerent types of MD simulations in the popular GROMACS simulation package. GROMACS is an open-source, free, and ﬂexible MD package that is consistently among the fastest in the world. The tutorials presented here range from a "simple" system of a protein in aqueous solution to more advanced concepts such as force ﬁeld organization and modiﬁcation for a membrane-protein system, two methods of calculating free energy diﬀerences (umbrella sampling and "alchemical" methods), biphasic systems, protein-ligand complexes, and the use of virtual sites in MD simulations. In this article, users are provided the rationale and a theoretical explanation for the command-line syntax in each step in the online tutorials (available at http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx) and the underlying settings and algorithms necessary to perform robust MD simulations in each scenario.},

We report apparent subdiffusion, observed via single particle tracking (SPT), in a homogeneous system that only allows normal diffusion (a DMPC monolayer in the fluid state). The apparent subdiffusion arises from slight errors in finding the actual particle position due to noise inherent in all experimental SPT systems. A model is presented that corrects this artifact, and predicts the time scales after which the effect becomes negligible. The techniques and results presented in this paper should be of use in all SPT experiments studying normal and anomalous diffusion.},

	abstract = {Summary: Computer simulations are giving way to more complex and accurate studies of biological membranes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The analysis of MD trajectories comprises the biophysical characterization of membrane properties or the study of protein–lipid interactions and dynamics. However, there is a lack of automated tools to analyse MD simulations of complex membrane or membrane-protein systems. Here we present MEMBPLUGIN, a plugin for the Visual Molecular Dynamics package that provides algorithms to measure a host of essential biophysical properties in simulated membranes. MEMBPLUGIN features are accessible both through a user-friendly graphical interface and as command-line procedures to be invoked in analysis scripts.
